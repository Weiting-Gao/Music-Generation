# Music-Generation
The project is to train a neural network with piano midi music to generate sample songs.

Project objective: Train a neural network with piano midi music acquired using Music21 -- a Python toolkit, so the NN could generate sample songs.
Type of neural network: LSTM and WaveNet
-  LSTM is a kind of RNN that is able to recognize and encode long-term patterns. 
- WaveNet is a deep neural network for generating raw audio. Itâ€™s literally a convolutional neural network.
 
Music21 toolkit will be employed to preprocess music files. With this package, we can extract musical notation from MIDI files.
